# PCars_Matrix_Portal
Telemetry display of Project Cars data on a 32x64 LED Display using Adafruit Matrix Portal board

This decodes and displays Project Cars 1 UDP Packets  
Project Cars 2 users just need to, in SYSTEM settings  
set "UDP Protocol Version" to "Project Cars 1"  
For help on this see: <https://www.projectcarsgame.com/two/02-options-and-settings>  
Search for "SYSTEM" settings  
Set the UDP Frequency setting in PCars to value 8  
9 is too slow and anything lower is too fast and there is too much lag  
Original API was found here...

Thanks to James Muscat and his project

For helping me figure out how to decode the UDP packets
